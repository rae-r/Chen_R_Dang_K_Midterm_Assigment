        Why dubbed anime is better than subbed.
   </header>
<li> It's better because you can watch it while doing other stuff such as cooking, or cleaning</li>
<li> It's better because you can enjoy the entire experience instead of reading the subtitles; your brain is 100% focused on the anime and not 50%
on reading and 50% on watching</li>
<li> English Voice Actors are easier to follow along with what's happening and easier to understand</li>
<li> Better for binge watching</li>
<li> Sometimes subtitles don't fully translate correctly or translate text on screen, 
but with English dub, it translates both voice and text</li>
<li> Better if you're a slow reader </li>
