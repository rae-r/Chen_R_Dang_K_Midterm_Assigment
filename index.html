    <h3>
        Why subbed anime is better than dubbed:
    </h3>
    <li>Original voice acting for original experience and culture</li>
    <li>Content won't be cut for dubbing purposes (Censoring, cutting scenes)</li>
    <li>Good if you're learning the language and need to know how it is spoken (slang and formal)</li>
    <li>Japanese voice actors are more emotional and feel more in-character</li>
    <li>More accessible and more available varied content</li>
    <li>Better for recent release and on release watching, can take a while for the English dub to release.</li>
